# C Program Explorations

Welcome to the C Program Explorations repository! This repository contains basic C programs and two projects: a simple guessing game and the Snake Water Gun game.

## Basic C Programs

In this repository, you'll find various basic C programs covering fundamental concepts such as:

- Input/output (printf, scanf)
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers

Feel free to explore these programs to understand and practice the basics of C programming.

## Projects

### 1. Simple Guessing Game

The simple guessing game is a console-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides hints to the user whether the guess is too high or too low, and the user continues guessing until they guess the correct number.

To run the guessing game, compile and execute the `Project1.c` file.

### 2. Snake Water Gun Game

The Snake Water Gun game is a console-based game where the user plays against the computer. Each player chooses one of three options: Snake, Water, or Gun. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
- Snake drinks water, wins.
- Water drowns gun, wins.
- Gun shoots snake, wins.

To play the Snake Water Gun game, compile and execute the `Project2.c` file.

## Running the Programs

To run any of the programs in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run.
3. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
4. Execute the compiled program.


## Contributing
